== Description ==

my_theme is a simple theme which is created for educational and experimental purpose. This theme has simple editing features.
The features are:

== PLUGINS ==

- Cursive -
  This plugin can be used to make any words or sentences to look like to be cursive which is good when one want to make the word or sentence more impactful and meaningful. The plugin uses the "PabasingSignature-q2x3d.otf" as the cursive font.

- Marker -
  This plugin can be use to highlight some word or sentence. When used a yellow line (#f5fd24) will be use as the background color to highlight the specific word or sentence. It can be use to highlight an important word or sentence.

- Underline -
  As the name suggests, this theme underlines any word or sentence that one needs to make the focus of the paragraph or even the page. This plugin will underline the word or sentence with color ("#21ff00") to make the word or sentence attractive and attentive.

== BLOCKS ==

- Sample Block -
  This blocks can be used to write an explanation about something without seperating blocks. This blocks includes a title and content sections. One can write the title and content without any worry as the blocks will atomatically do the job for centering the title and maintaining the font difference.

= IMAGE =
Image block has different styles to choose from as:

- カスタム
  This styles the image by making the edges round by 30%.

- 白黒 -
  This changes the image into black and white by "grayscale(50%)" which gives vintage look to the image.

- cssアニメーション -
  This animates the image as the image zoom-in which make the page look attractive.

- css直 -
  The image will be look little bit transparent with the opacity(0.5).

- 角丸+影付き -
  This will make the radius 20% with the animation from cssアニメーション. This is the combibnation of the カスタム and cssアニメーション with little bit of editing.

== PATTERN ==

- Table -
  This is a simple table. This can use for simple purposes. The rows of the table is colored gray in even order. There is some table head that can be used as it is or one can also delete the content and write their own.

-- Media & Text --
This plugin can be found in Block panel from the start but here I have made some changes to the orginal. Here I have added a speech bubble in which you can write your text or explanation about the image. It can be used when one want to write something aside of a image. The users also can freely choose wheather they want to write in left-side or right-side of the image as well. and the speech bubble is responsive in which the bubble will appear above the image in mobile devices.
